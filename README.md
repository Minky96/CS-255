DriverPass the client for the semester was very exciting to work for. They wanted our team to create a
web application for them that would make it easier for student drivers to earn their license. The web
application is very immersive, and I think it would make it very easy for anyone to pass their driver
exams.
Throughout the course I think my models of the web application I think that I did very well. I think that I
was able to capture the functions correctly and after looking at the models I believe that I was able to
understand what they wanted.
I think that my UML class diagram was not the best I was not sure how some of the class were
integrated. I believe that I got the functions correct for each class, but when I tried to show which class
each other were affiliated with I was not sure.
One of the major needs DrvierPass wanted to have in their web application was the reservation and
scheduling of the on-the-road driving courses. To implement this, I had to make the users capable of
scheduling and the ability to change the schedule if anything were to come up. Also, when scheduled
the instructor needed the time and date added to their schedule so they are aware as well. Of course,
Administrators also needed the ability to make changes.
There are two different approaches for software design, top-down design, and bottom-up design. Top-
down design takes the while software system as one entity and then decomposes it to achieve more
than one sub-system or component based on some characteristics. The bottom-up design model starts
with most specific and basic components. It then builds higher-level components making use of basic or
lower-level components. I think top-down design is better for it allows to team to see every aspect
before they start coding and creating.
